# Logistic-Regression : **Titanic Survival and Airbnb Price Prediction**

**Overview**
The first part of the project focuses on the Titanic disaster, aiming to examine the accuracy of survivors' accounts about the last hours of the ship. Logistic regression is used to identify factors that influenced survival, such as gender, age, and passenger class.

The second part of the project involves predicting Airbnb listing prices in Vancouver, BC. Data cleaning and transformation are performed, including converting price to numeric, handling missing values, and exploring price distributions. Linear regression models are built to explain the log price based on the number of bedrooms, room type, and the number of accommodates.

Titanic Analysis
In the Titanic analysis, we investigate the reliability of survivors' accounts regarding the order of evacuation during the disaster. By using logistic regression, we identify the most critical factors that affected survival, such as gender, age, and passenger class. The goal is to gain insights into the tragic event and understand the distribution of survival chances among different groups of passengers.

Airbnb Price Prediction
The Airbnb price prediction analysis aims to estimate listing prices for accommodations in Vancouver, BC. Through data cleaning and log transformation, we prepare the dataset for linear regression modeling. We include variables such as room type, number of bedrooms, and number of accommodates to build predictive models for pricing.
